# Hello human üòé

I'm a normal human being (or not üëΩ) and I create software.

Most of my time I was in front of a computer creating side-projects, learning new things or Just watching on Netflix üçø.

I'm currently working on Estilo Bantu (not a technological product). A clothes brand where our main focus is to show African (bantu's) cultural side and in other side showing some modern styles.
